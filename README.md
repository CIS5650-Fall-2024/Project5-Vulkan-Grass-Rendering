### Result & Features

Features: 
- culling test
  - orientation culling test

    ![](./img/result1.gif)
    Orietation culling is based on if the view direction is not in the same direction as orientation, since the grass has no width, it will cause aliasing effect.

  - view frustum culling test

    ![](./img/result2.gif)

    view frustum culling is based on if the grass is inside camera view, if it is not, the grass will not be rendered.

  - distance culling test

    ![](./img/result3.gif)

    distance culling is based on if grass is too far away from the camera, if it is too far, it will not be rendered.

- physics simulation (no force shown below)

  - gravity force

    ![](./img/result5.gif)

    gravity force will be applied to the grass. since there is no other force be applied to grass, all of grass is laid down. 

  - recovery force (with gravity)

    ![](./img/result6.gif)

    with recovery force, the grass will be back to form a relatively steady position for the grass. 

  - wind force (with gravity and wind)

    with wind force, it will give grass a wind effect. I am using a wind force as sine function to get a effect to grass floating back and force. 

### Performance & Analysis

![](./img/analysis1.png)
The FPS descreases as the blades counts become higher, especially when it reaches around 2^15. However, it roughly stays the same for low blades count (since threads count might be larger than blades count).


![](./img/analysis2.png)
The FPS get increased for all culling method individually. (culling test on same view with same blade count). Distance culling gives better performance improvement for this certain view compared to the other twos. All together, it gives best performance improvement.
